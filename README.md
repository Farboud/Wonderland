# Wonderland
This is a programme to implement the wonderland model by Herbert and Leeves (1998)

The main file to run is "wonderland.py".
It requires Python3 with tkinter and numpy libraries.

"calc.py" does the actual computing and "gui.py" is responsible for generating the visual output.

"Wonderland (old).py" and "tk (old).py" are preliminary codes and are not needed.
